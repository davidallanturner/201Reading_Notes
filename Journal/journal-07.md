# Overcoming Challenges

I have to say, I expected much of CodeFellows to be different. It has had its challeneges.
Many of the challenges I have had to face have been external to me, but I know that there have been some that are definately internal to me as well.

A slew of things have worked against me to make things very hard. I joined CodeFellows at a very difficult time for me. I pursued this course however, because I know that if I did not do it now, another similar opportunity with the VA, would be unlikely to come around again.

Firstly, for some time now, my job has been in some amount of jeopardy.

This has been very tough on me, but especially for another very tough issue that affect my schooling right now.

I have a brand new daughter. 2 month old baby girl -- Rebecca Turner.

Just 3 months ago, our landlord decided to sell our house. They gave us 30 days to move out. My wife was less than 30 days to due. I had work, and was packing like a mad man. I needed labor, but with everyone moving, movers were booked out months in advance.
On top of this, the landlord required that we showed the property to potential buyers while we were moving out, and my wife was unvaccinated, on bed rest, and doesn't drive, so she couldn't just head out when visitors wanted to see the house.

In the middle of this, my father passed away in California. I traveled down there with my son for 2 days to see the funeral, and traveled back home again, because there were still more problems.

People were selling homes, not renting, and places that were renting had no room at the inn. Houses were going sight unseen with deposits being put down before even viewing the houses.

With no place to go to, we did the only thing we could do. Went to an extended stay. We were here for 15 days until I found a place. I put a deposit down, sight unseen on a home for rent, because we needed a home. This also meant everything had to be moved into and stored into a storage unit. At least my things had a home.

The move back in came with its share of dificulties. The house was in bad shape when we moved in. The landlord has worked hard to the issues in the meantime, but many persist, so things were not moved over in one easy go. We are still slowly moving back in. Only yesterday did the bed get put back together.

School has had its challenges too. I am using a team called Veterans Transition Mission to help me find a school. With all the changes to the way things work with Covid19, VTM gave me many options. I was about to go with a college from another area, since the GI Bill is going to be one of the only ways I can pay for this program. Thankfully, I was given some info last minute by the CF's awesome military liasion.
P.S. Doesn't matter what she gets paid, it's not enough. That woman is an amazing beast.

Starting CodeFellows after moving into a much smaller location posed logistics challenges. My old house had an office where I could study. Now, I have to use the master bedroom. It's not terrible, but it certainly means my wife is not sleeping on the bed at 9 every night. (I feel bad hunny, I really do.)

After work and before school, I have TMS therapy sessions. It is on the other side of town. I don't get home until it is about 15 minutes until class starts. Just enough time to see my kids, kiss the wife and jump on a call.

Speaking of kids. Both of our moms were here for a month each to "help." I'm sure you can imagine that when I use quotes, I don't really mean it. Mostly, and understandably, they were here to see my wife and daughter. This means I have barely had the chance to see or hold my daughter since she's been born. **oof that's rough**

My computer has been stuborn with me since the start. First issues with the graphics card and BSOD random restarts (which are STILL happening), then issues with installation of necessary files(that still persist), and bad wiring in the house that has caused me to have a TERRIBLE connection since the start of the program (which I only solved 2 days ago by the way).

I also had a number of issues to deal with for the start of my program, ranging from installation issues, to difficulty understanding some of the instructions, to issues with deliveries to me and issues with system usage and access.

I'm now dealing with the VA screwing up my paperwork, and wondering what that means for me.

But I persist. This too, shall pass. Like all other trials in my life, I have survived them.

I have been really working on working on myself in these last few months. Most especially, I have worked on trying to work though how I see the world and who I am. Death of a parent has a way of doing that.

I am hopeful. I'm learning, I'm growing. I've been dealing with things I need to deal with. I've been taking steps to make things better for me.

CodeFellows is only one branch in that tree, but I hope it's a big branch.

For my "Partner Power Hour," I have chosen to do a write up of the the Q&A session with Ryan Pedersen.

For me, there were a great number of takeaways from what I heard. I asked 4 questions, and he answered all 4 of them, even if they weren't directly asked to him (though two were).

My questions were on point, and I believed were where I wanted to go with this write-up, but once I heard him speaking, I realized that there was a much bigger place and issue that I wanted to write up.

I have, for a long time, been a very private person. This has come because of extreme depression. When Ryan spoke to the issue of being a know-it-all vs a learn-it-all, I think I heard something very important.

I've been called a know-it-all in my life many times. Just as many times, I've felt like I was not, and simply wanted to learn more. I think that his statement on needing to continue to be flexible, and learn more, really spoke to me. I feel like I am always wanting to learn more, but I think that it is very important to internalize this ideology.

I think there was another amazing point that I received from his Q&A session. I asked the question, "What would you define as a successfuly skilled junior developer?"

The answer to this question, was quite interesting to me. His response that the company only needed people with 1 year of skill and are able to navigate complex structures, truly surprised me.

If I had another chance to ask another question, I'd ask about "The Great Resignation" and what that could mean for us. I'd be inclined to believe that this market is very ripe for those of us who have some experience and are ready to jump in to a job.

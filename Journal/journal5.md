# Why?

*Can we really ever truly know why we do what we do?*

I'd like to believe that we can change without a why. Perhaps it is possible to change without a why. Here's an example. Adult with a busted car that is the only mode of transportation doesn't need to know any why's to know that it must be fixed. He doesn't need to know why it needs to be fixed, he doesn't have to ask that question. It's as plain as the nose on his face. Maybe someone could argue that in this particular example, they already know why they need to fix it. This is true, but it belies the point of the article. Similarly, there are many people who know they need to do something different. They know why they should do something different. They have their why, but it does not make them ready to start.

Knowing why, just is not enough.
It's not.

One of my friends is a physical therapist. He's working to become a doctor, but he told me that the patients he has the hardest time with keeping on the wagon to get better, are the ones who need it the most. If a doctor tells a person, that if they don't change, they'll have another heart attack, that person may, or may not change. They know the why. Many of them think about their families and loved ones when they suffer, but when the long road to getting better comes, the why, is suddenly less important. They have a hard time sticking to the script and following very wise advice.

## Why?

Why is a loaded question, and many would like us to believe that knowing why will fix everything. It won't. It can help a lot, but knowing why the US suffered from the financial crisis in 2010, does not change the fact, that many of us could do nothing to change it. The why, did not help at all.

So what should the real question be?
What should we take from this?

We need to understand motivation. Rubber meet road.

## Motivation

In the book, *The Procrastination Equation*, Ph.D. Piers Steel makes the case that motivation is something that most every parent in the world knows.
  **Carrot** *&* **Stick**

That's right. Knowing why is very helpful, but many people who know why they should do something, still don't do it. WHY?

*Expectancy* * *Value*
---
*Impulsiveness* * *Delay*

or

*Carrot*
---
*Stick*

Why do we have laws? Shouldn't people do the right thing if they know to do it?
Of course they should, but sometimes, the right thing isn't what they want. How do we make sure that people stick to doing the right thing?
The Stick. The Law.

If the benefits outweigh the posibility of failure, it will result in desire and motivation to do something. If the reward of eating healthy is living longer, what does that mean to the depressed person who got to where they were already? Nothing. What if the reward of eating healthy, was a billion dollars?
Do you think they'd REALLY try? If the money was really in front of them, you can be your own bottom dollar, they'd try.

That's the point.

Knowing the why, that is, the value of why you want to do something, is worthless if you have no expectation to complete the thing, or your desire to do something else in its place is greater.

The book outlines a number of great ways to increase the carrot or stick depending on what you need, and reduce drag and lack of desire. There's a great poster on it! I have one printed and hanging in my office at work.

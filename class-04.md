#Links (anchor)

Links move you from one page to another on the web

In the beginning of the web, there was only text, and then Sir Tim Berners-Lee said let there be links, and there were links!

Links can go from either page to page or part of a page to another part of a page

Links can open up in the same page or in a new page

Links do not have to be to HTML sites, they can be for other protocols as well, such as: zoom, mail, torrent, etc.

links are set with the <a>(anchor) element
eg: <a></a>

Links do not have to be text, images and other things can be links

Back in the day, map used to be used with links to create complex shapes with links over certain parts of the image.
 An example of this was a literal map that had links built in over the states.
 Map is still used sometimes, but is not really used quite often.
